# object-recognition-with-neural-nets

I'm playing around with classifiers to build the ultimate classfier using neural networks. Welcome to my playground.

## Getting Started

```
# create virtual environment
virtualenv venv


# activate environment
souce venv/bin/activate


# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt


# run jupyter notebook
jupyter-notebook


```
This is made purely for understanding how neural networks work, the code used is not optimized in any way.
